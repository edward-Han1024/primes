# primes
A .js file that generates primes over 5 lists. needs at least 32GB of memory to generate 500 million primes.
The results are split over 5 files (github limits files to 100MiB)
## 500 Million!
I have successfully calculated all primes under 500 million. It took about 2 minutes and most comprising of filling lists. I will not do further calculations as I do not have enough memory for them and I do not want to update the script to store the large lists on the disk (which I have more than enough of).
